 * Write a Profiler::Writer class that will generate a output from a 
   Profiler::Consumer. Writer should be an abstract class, classes derived
   from Writer should implement a specific output format.
 * Implement proper handling for template functions in Profiler::Consumer.
 * Write a functionality test suite for the profiler. Bugger people into
   providing simple test cases.
